# San-Francisco-Housing-Pricing

This is a project I created and followed along at the beginning of my data analytics career to be familiar with the data cleaning, analyzing, and modeling process. Many of the code, as well as the ML model used in here are very basic and the implementations are far from perfect, it is just to keep track of my progress.
